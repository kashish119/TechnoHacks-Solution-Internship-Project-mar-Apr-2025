I’ve built a responsive navigation menu with a search bar, fully designed using HTML, CSS, and Media Queries. The design is sleek, user-friendly, and adapts beautifully to all screen sizes — from desktops to mobile devices.
🛠️ Technologies Used:
✔ HTML5
✔ CSS3
✔ Media Queries
✨ This project was completed as part of my web development internship with Technohacks Edutech Solution.
