I showcase a simple and clean Product Card UI built using HTML, CSS  as part of my internship project with Technohacks Edutech. 
The product card includes a container displaying an image, product name, short description, and buttons like "Buy Now" and "Add to Cart". 
It's a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates responsive design, styling, and interaction.
